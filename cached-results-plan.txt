Mutmut cached results plan:

- Change apply logic from "file/index" to "file/{line source}/index"

class SurvivingMutant:
    line: str
    mutants: [indexes: int]
    

- Store lines with no surviving mutants {filepath: set[SurvivingMutant]}
- Store hashes of source files {filepath: hash}
- Store hash of entire tests directory (for now... otherwise I need to build specific support for each test runner?)
